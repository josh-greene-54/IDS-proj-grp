# IDS-proj-grp
Institute of Data Science Project, Life Expectancy and GDP Per Capita Relationship

Note to Professor Moore and Ali:

Our group attempted to make many adjustments in a short period of time after giving our presentation. We spent a long time attempting to establish a new dataset for a LASSO model which would lead into a new multiple linear regression model, but found ourselves stuck trying to wrangle the data to finish the LASSO process. We adjusted our old data to be without death rates, but we still believe birth rates to be a significant predictor in life expectancy due to the social context behind different birth rates. We added our QQ plot and tested the model for heteroskedasticity, which you will find in our paper, and added a second predictor to our machine learning model (Healthcare Expenditure per Capita). 

Thank you for a great "semester!"
